//! Compatibility between different async runtimes for Arti
//!
//! We try to isolate these dependencies in a single place so that
//! we depend only on a minimal set of required features that our
//! runtime needs to give us.
//!
//! Right now, this crate exposes a small subset of the async_std
//! runtime, and the async_io rutime that it's built on, for use by
//! the rest of Arti.  Later we should add tokio support.  When we do
//! so, we may change which APIs this crate exposes, depending on
//! which interface is easier to build based on the other.
