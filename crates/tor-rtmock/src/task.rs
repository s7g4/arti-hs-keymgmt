///
/// It will usually be used as part of a `MockRuntime`.
///
/// To run futures, call [`ToplevelBlockOn::block_on`]
///
/// # Restricted environment
///
/// Tests run with this executor must not attempt to block
/// on anything "outside":
/// every future that anything awaits must (eventually) be woken directly
/// *by some other task* in the same test case.
///
/// (By directly we mean that the [`Waker::wake`] call is made
/// by that waking future, before that future itself awaits anything.)
///
/// # Panics
///
/// The executor will panic
/// if the toplevel future (passed to `block_on`)
/// doesn't complete (without externally blocking),
/// but instead waits for something.
///
/// The executor will malfunction or panic if reentered.

    /// The technique used to capture backtraces when futures sleep is not 100% exact.
    /// It will usually show all the actual sleeping sites,
    /// but it might also show other backtraces which were part of
    /// the implementation of some complex relevant future.
    ///
    /// **Details**
    ///
    /// When a future's implementation wants to sleep,
    /// it needs to record the [`Waker`] (from the [`Context`])
    /// so that the "other end" can call `.wake()` on it later,
    /// when the future should be woken.
    ///
    /// Since `Context.waker()` gives `&Waker`, borrowed from the `Context`,
    /// the future must clone the `Waker`,
    /// and it must do so in within the `poll()` call.
    ///
    /// A future which is waiting in a `select!` will typically
    /// show multiple traces, one for each branch.
    /// But,
    /// if a future sleeps on one thing, and then when polled again later,
    /// sleeps on something different, without waking up in between,
    /// both backtrace locations will be shown.
    /// And,
    /// a complicated future contraption *might* clone the `Waker` more times.
