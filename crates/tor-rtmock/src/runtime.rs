/// Completely mock runtime
///
/// Suitable for test cases that wish to completely control
/// the environment experienced by the code under test.
///
/// ### Restrictions
///
/// The test case must advance the mock time explicitly as desired,
/// typically by calling one of the `MockRuntime::advance_*` methods.
///
/// Tests that use this runtime *must not* interact with the outside world;
/// everything must go through this runtime (and its pieces).
///
/// #### Allowed
///
///  * Inter-future communication facilities from `futures`
///    or other runtime-agnostic crates.
///
///  * Fast synchronous operations that will complete "immediately" or "quickly".
///    E.g.: filesystem calls.
///
///  * `std::sync::Mutex` (assuming the use is deadlock-free in a single-threaded
///    executor, as it should be in all of Arti).
///
///  * Slower operations that are run synchronously (without futures `await`)
///    provided their completion doesn't depend on any of the futures we're running.
///    (These kind of operations are often discouraged in async contexts,
///    because they block the async runtime or its worker threads.
///    But they are often OK in tests.)
///
///  * All facilities provided by this `MockExecutor` and its trait impls.
///
/// #### Not allowed
///
///  * Direct access to the real-world clock (`SystemTime::now`, `Instant::now`).
///    Including `coarsetime`, which is not mocked.
///    Exception: CPU use measurements.
///
///  * Anything that spawns threads and then communicates with those threads
///    using async Rust facilities (futures).
///
///  * Async sockets, or async use of other kernel-based IPC or network mechanisms.
///
///  * Anything provided by a Rust runtime/executor project (eg anything from Tokio),
///    unless it is definitively established that it's runtime-agnostic.
