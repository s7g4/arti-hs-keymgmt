/// A runtime that we can use to run Tor as a client.
///
/// This trait comprises several other traits that we require all of our
/// runtimes to provide:
///
/// * [`futures::task::Spawn`] to launch new background tasks.
/// * [`SleepProvider`] to pause a task for a given amount of time.
/// * [`CoarseTimeProvider`] for a cheaper but less accurate notion of time.
/// * [`NetStreamProvider`] to launch and accept network connections.
/// * [`TlsProvider`] to launch TLS connections.
/// * [`Blocking`] to be able to run synchronous (cpubound or IO) code,
///   and *re*-enter the async context from synchronous thread
///   (This may become optional in the future, if/when we add WASM
///   support).
///
/// Some `Runtime` values can also be used to enter the corresponding async executor;
/// those are [`ToplevelBlockOn`] and therefore [`ToplevelRuntime`]s.
///
/// We require that every `Runtime` has an efficient [`Clone`] implementation
/// that gives a new opaque reference to the same underlying runtime.
///
/// Additionally, every `Runtime` is [`Send`] and [`Sync`], though these
/// requirements may be somewhat relaxed in the future.
///
/// At some future point,
/// Arti may require that the runtime `impl<S> TlsProvider<S>` (for suitable`S`),
/// rather than just for their own `TcpStream`s.
/// I.e., Arti may start to require that the runtime's TLS provider can wrap any streams,
/// not only the runtime's own TCP streams.
/// This might be expressed as an additional supertrait bound on `Runtime`,
/// eg when Rust supports GATs,
/// or as an additional bound on the Arti APIs that currently use `Runtime`.
/// For API future compatibility, if you `impl Runtime for MyRuntime`,
/// you should also ensure that you
/// ```ignore
/// impl<S> TlsProvider<S> for MyRuntime
/// where S: futures::AsyncRead + futures::AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send + 'static
/// ```
//
/// Perhaps we will need this if we make our own TLS connections *through* Tor,
/// rather than just channels to guards.

///
/// This supports two use cases: blocking IO and CPU-intensive activities.
/// (In both of these cases, simply calling the functions within an `async` task
/// is a bad idea, because that can block the whole async runtime.)
///
/// ### Blocking IO
///
/// `Blocking` can be used to interact with libraries or OS primitives
/// that only offer a synchronous, blocking, interface.
///
/// Use [`spawn_thread`](Blocking::spawn_thread)
/// when it is convenient to have a long-running thread,
/// for these operations.
///
/// Use [`blocking_io`](Blocking::blocking_io)
/// when the blocking code is usually expected to be complete quickly,
/// and/or you will be switching back and forth a lot
/// between sync and async contexts.
/// Note that you cannot call back to async code from within `blocking_io`.
///
/// ### CPU-intensive activities
///
/// Perform CPU-intensive work, that ought not to block the program's main loop,
/// via [`Blocking::spawn_thread`].
///
/// `spawn_thread` does not apply any limiting or prioritisation;
/// its threads simply compete for CPU with other threads in the program.
/// That must be done by the caller; therefore:
///
/// **Limit the number of cpu threads** spawned
/// in order to limit the total amount of CPU time consumed by any part of the program.
/// For example, consider using one CPU thread per Tor Hidden Service.
///
/// It is most performant to spawn a long-running thread,
/// rather than to repeatedly spawn short-lived threads for individual work items.
/// This also makes it easier to limit the number of concurrente cpu threads.
/// For the same reason, [`Blocking::blocking_io`] should be avoided
/// for the CPU-intensive use case.
///
/// ### Mapping to concrete functions from underlying libraries
///
/// The semantics of `Blocking` are heavily influenced by Tokio
/// and by the desire to be able to use tor-rtmock's `MockExecutor` to test Arti code.
///
/// | `tor-rtcompat`               | Tokio                 | `MockExecutor`                 |

    /// which has both of these properties.)

    ///
    /// ### How to use `spawn_thread` correctly
    ///
    ///  * Spawn the thread with `SpawnThread::spawn_thread`.
    ///  * On that thread, receive work items from from the async environment
    ///    using async inter-task facilities (eg `mpsc::channel`),
    ///    called via [`reenter_block_on`](Blocking::reenter_block_on).
    ///  * Return answers with async inter-task facilities, calling either
    ///    a non-blocking immediate send (eg `[try_send`])
    ///    or an async send call via `reneter_block_on`.
    ///
    /// ### CPU-intensive work

    /// Limit the number of CPU-intensive concurrent threads spawned with `spawn_thread`.

/// because the certificate that a Tor relay uses in TLS is not actually being
