//! Macros to make it easier to work with rate-limited logs
//!

/// Log a rate-limited failure message.
///
/// This macro looks at a single `Result<T,E>`,
/// and keeps track of how many times the `Ok` and `Err` branches are seen.
/// After a delay, it reports via [`tracing::event!`]
/// how many errors it has seen since its last report.
/// (It only reports an absence of errors
/// when such an absence has followed
/// an error report.)
///
/// ## A simple example
///
/// ```
/// # use std::num::ParseIntError;
/// # let s = "1234";
/// # let source = "the cache";
/// use tor_log_ratelim::log_ratelim;
///  let r: Result<u8, ParseIntError> = s.parse();
///
/// log_ratelim!(
///   // The activity we were doing.
///   "Parsing a value from {}", source;
///   // The result we got.
///   r;
/// );
/// ```
///
/// This invocation could report errors like
/// ```text
/// WARN: Parsing a value from the cache: error (occurred 9/12 times in the last 5 minutes): number too large to fit in target type
/// ```
///
/// After a while without errors, it might log:
/// ```text
/// WARN: Parsing a value from the cache: now working (occurred 0/100 times in th last hour)
/// ```
///
/// ## Important concept: Activities
///
/// Every invocation of `log_ratelim!` defines a _set_ of rate limits
/// with respect to a collection of **activities**.  
/// Each separate **activity** value gets its own rate limit.
/// This lets you have separate rate limits for different operations,
/// such as connecting to different parties,
/// or invoking different programs.
///
/// Typical activities might be
/// `"Connecting to port {}", p`
/// or
/// `"Trying to start program {}", p`
///
/// (These activities should be described using a verb ending with "-ing",
/// to make the output nice.)
///
/// ## Requirements on the error type.
///
/// The error type for each `Result` passed to this macro must implement:
///  * [`Clone`]
///  * [`Send`]
///  * [`Error`](std::error::Error)
///
/// ## Reports are representative
///
/// No matter how many failures are seen between log messages,
/// `log_ratelim!` only records and reports
/// one error for each time it logs.
///
/// Its current behavior is to record and report
/// the _first_ error for each logged interval,
/// and discard the others.  
/// This can lead to confusing results if the error is not representative.
///
/// ## Advanced syntax
///
/// The `log_ratelim` macro can record additional information for its
/// representative error report,
/// and can log information on successes as well.
///
/// A full invocation of `log_ratelim!` looks like this:
///
/// ```
/// # use std::num::ParseIntError;
/// # let s = "1234";
/// # let source = "the cache";
/// # let more_information = |_| "";
/// use tor_log_ratelim::log_ratelim;
/// let r: Result<u8, ParseIntError> = s.parse();
/// log_ratelim!(
///   "Parsing a value from {}", source;
///   r;
///   Err(x) => WARN, "The problem was {}", more_information(x);
///   Ok(v) => TRACE, "Parsed {} successfully", v;
/// );
/// ```
///
/// Here the clause starting with `Err(x)`
/// tells the logger to include a message along with the error report,
/// and we explicitly specifies the level at which
/// to log our failure reports.
///
/// Note that the error itself is **always** reported;
/// there is no need to say
/// `Err(e) => WARN, "{}", e`.
/// In fact, doing so will create a redundant report of
/// the error.
//
// TODO: I don't think it makes sense to have an Ok() logger.
// Instead, we could just say
//    log_ratelim!("Parsing a value from {}", source; r;);
//    trace!("parsed value from {}: {:?}", source, r);
// This is probably better, since it logs a trace for every occurrence.
//
/// The clause starting with `Ok(v)` tells the logger what to do on success:
/// each individual success causes a _non-rate-limited_
/// message at TRACE level.
///
/// The `Ok() ...` clause
/// and the `Err() ...` clause
/// are both optional.
///
/// Within the Err() clause,
/// the format string and its arguments
/// are optional.
//
// TODO performance notes:
//
// There are many opportunities for possibly making this code go faster:
//  - Optimize the case where there is only one activity.
//  - Use a non-string key to distinguish activities, to avoid formatting
//    the activity string needlessly.
//  - Limit copies (of activity and of error).
//  - Use Event and Metadata from the tracing crate to defer formatting
//  - Check Metadata early for the case where we don't want to report the
//    event at all.
//
// Let's not pursue any of these until we know that this code actually
// shows up in a critical path.
