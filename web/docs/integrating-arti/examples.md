# Examples

The following are sample projects built with Arti.

- [**Download Manager**][download-manager] is a small download manager prototype which can connect to the Tor network and get a copy of the Tor browser from there.

- [**Pt-proxy**][pt-proxy] provides an interface to run the obfs4 pluggable transport in a standalone manner, ie, instead of using obfs4 to connect to the Tor network, we can use it to connect to the Internet directly.

- [**DNS resolver**][dns-resolver] uses Tor to make a DNS over TCP request for a hostname, and get IP addresses back.

- [**Connection checker**][connection-checker] attempts to check connectivity to the Tor network through a variety of ways.
