# Safer build options

By default, the Rust compiler includes your current path information in the binaries that it generates.
This could be a problem if, for example, you are building from a path like `/home/FirstnameLastname/build/arti` and releasing binaries (or uploading backtraces) under a pseudonym that you do not want linked to `FirstnameLastname`.

There is a good overview of the issues here at [https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/issues/57](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/issues/57) .

To work around this issue, you can use one of the following options:

### Reproducible build

If you have Docker, you can run a reproducible build of Arti, so that the binary you make will be the same as a binary generated by anybody else.

See the [`docker_reproducible_build`](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/maint/docker_reproducible_build) script for more information.

### RUSTFLAGS

As a quick-and-dirty solution, you can use the `--remap-path-prefix` option to tell the Rust compiler to re-map your paths into anonymized ones.

This is not a perfect solution; there are known issues under some configurations, particularly if you are linking to a static OpenSSL.

You can get good results from running:

```
RUSTFLAGS="--remap-path-prefix $HOME/.cargo=.cargo --remap-path-prefix $(pwd)=." \
   cargo build --release -p arti
```

After you do this, you can use `strings target/release/arti | grep "$HOME"` to see if your home directory appears in the result.
