//! Utilities to decode/encode things into bytes.
//!
//! We use these to build and handle all the byte-encoded objects from
//! the Tor protocol.  For textual directory items, see the tor-netdoc
//! crate.
//!
//! These tools are generally unsuitable for handling anything bigger
//! than a few kilobytes in size.
//!
//! # Alternatives
//!
//! The Reader/Writer traits in std::io are more appropriate for
//! operations that can fail because of some IO problem.  These can't;
//! they are for handling things that are already in memory.
//!
//! TODO: There are other crates that try the "bytes" crate that can
//! handle stuff like this, but it's rather bigger than I need. They
//! seem to be optimized for working with things that are split across
//! multiple chunks.
//!
//! TODO: The "untrusted" crate is designed for parsing untrusted
//! inputs in a way that can never panic.  We might want to look into
//! using that as a backend instead.
